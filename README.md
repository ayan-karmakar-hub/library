/********** Summary ***********/

For this project, I created a "library" that can store several books.
The main purpose of the project was to get more familiar with objects
and ways to maniuplate them.

/******** Relevant Files *********/

index.html: Basic html code annotating shelf and form

styles.css: The css file that contains all styling done to the HTML.

play-game.js: JavaScript code that handles adding,removing and
reading books. I was surprised how much cleaner my JavaScript code
was for this project. I am assuming it was a combination of me
becoming more familiar with the language and the assignment
relying on objects to organize code.
